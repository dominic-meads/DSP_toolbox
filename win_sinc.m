function h = win_sinc(tBW,fc,win);
% DESCRIPTION
%  calculates a LOW PASS windowed-sinc FIR filter kernel
%  All other frequency responses can be obtained using LPF 
%  and spectral inversion. Includes an m/2 shift to avoid 
%  negative indexes (which MATLAB does not allow).
%
%  ex. h = LP_win_sinc(tBW,fc,win);
%
% INPUT VARIABLES
%  tBW : bandwidth of transition band (expressed as decimal) MUST MAKE M
%        AN EVEN NUMBER (m = 4/tBW) ex. 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, etc...
%  fc : cuttoff frequency of filter expressed as a decimal (no greater than
%       0.5 * fsample)
%  win : this function supports both Hamming and Blackman 
%        windows. Hamming yields faster roll-off while Blackman gives 
%        an order of magnitude better stop-band attenuation. 
%        1 = hamming
%        2 = blackman
%
% OUTPUT VARIABLES
%  h : vector of double precision numbers containing the filter kernel
